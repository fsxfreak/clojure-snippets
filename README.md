clojure-snippets
================

A collection of Clojure code snippets that I've written to learn and to play with Clojure.

###Exploring
The code snippets reside in their respective project folder generated by [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen). If you want to take a look at some of the code, traverse the directories in this way:
```
/<snippet-name>/src/<snippet-name>/<source-name>.clj
```

###Project List and Comments
* **daily-programmer-131** - My first foray into Clojure, solves the reddit /r/dailyprogrammer [Problem #131 [Easy]](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/1heozl/070113_challenge_131_easy_who_tests_the_tests/)
* **codeeval-1** - This snippet solves [codeeval](http://www.codeeval.com)'s Fizz Buzz challenge. Because I'm more used to the syntax now, I didn't spend as much time fixing mismatched parentheses and pouring over clojuredocs for the correct function usage. However, coming from C++, it was difficult for me to translate if, else if, and else constructs to Clojure. All in all, from this snippet, I've learned more about parsing and conditionals.
