clojure-snippets
================

A collection of Clojure code snippets that I've written to learn and to play with Clojure.

###Exploring
The code snippets reside in their respective project folder generated by [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen). If you want to take a look at some of the code, traverse the directories in this way:
```
/<snippet-name>/src/<snippet-name>/<source-name>.clj
```
